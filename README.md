# Time-Series-Anlaysis

The provided code is part of a Jupyter Notebook focused on time series analysis of stock data using Python. The code imports necessary libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib for data manipulation, fetching stock data, and creating visualizations. It demonstrates three different types of plots:

1. Line Plot: The code fetches historical stock data for AAPL (Apple Inc.) using the yfinance library and creates a line plot of the closing prices over time. The x-axis represents dates, the y-axis represents closing prices, and the plot showcases the trend in Apple's stock prices.

2. Candlestick Chart: The code utilizes the mplfinance library to generate a candlestick chart, a visualization commonly used in financial analysis. The chart illustrates open, close, high, and low prices for each trading period (usually days), offering insights into price movements and trends.

3. Bar Plot: Another bar plot is generated to display the closing prices over time. This visualization employs bars to represent the closing prices on the y-axis against corresponding dates on the x-axis.

Additionally, there is an example of creating a custom date range line plot within the provided dataset, focusing on the period between July 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. This customized plot allows for a closer examination of stock price trends within that specific time frame.

Overall, the code showcases different visualizations and techniques commonly used in time series analysis of stock data, allowing for the exploration of trends, patterns, and insights in stock price behavior.
